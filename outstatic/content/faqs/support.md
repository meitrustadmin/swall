## FAQs

**1. What is Swall and how does it work?**\
Swall is a decentralized platform that allows creators to turn their meme channels into digital assets. You have full control over your content, how it’s monetized, and how it’s shared with your community. Swall enables creators to monetize through bonding curves, peer-to-peer promotion, and community engagement. Followers can purchase member licenses, participate in activities, and help grow the channel.\
 \
**2. What is a bonding curve?** \
A bonding curve is a dynamic pricing model based on supply and demand. On Swall, the bonding curve determines the price of member licenses, which increases as more people join a creator's channel, allowing creators to benefit from community growth.\
 \
**3. How do I join a meme channel on Swall?** \
Joining a meme channel is free, but you'll need to purchase a member license using the bonding curve model to participate in community activities and access the promotion marketplace to earn more rewards.\
 \
**4. What are tips, and how do they work?** \
Tips are small payments that users send to creators or community members to show appreciation for their content or contributions. Tips can be sent through meme posts or chat, creating a flow of value within the community.\
 \
**5. What is peer-to-peer promotion, and how does the promotion link system work?** \
Peer-to-peer promotion lets users share your channel's promotion link across their networks. You and the referrers earn rewards when new members join through these links. The multi-level referral system tracks each share, helping you expand your reach while rewarding those who promote your content.\
 \
**6. What is multi-protocol communication?** \
In Web3, multi-protocol communication refers to the ability to interact with and integrate various decentralized protocols, networks, and blockchain systems within the decentralized web. Web3 envisions a new internet paradigm where users have full control over their data, identities, and digital assets, eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries such as traditional websites or platforms.\
\
How Multi-Protocol Communication Fits into Web3\
\\

1. Interoperability Between Blockchains:\
   Blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Bitcoin, SUI, and Nervos operate with distinct protocols. A multi-protocol communication system allows these blockchains to interoperate, seamlessly transferring assets, data, and value across chains.\
   Cross-chain bridges and interoperability protocols enable tokens and data to move securely and efficiently between different blockchain networks, improving liquidity and expanding the utility of decentralized applications (dApps).\
   \\
2. Decentralized Applications (dApps) Compatibility:\
   dApps are built on various blockchains, each with its protocol for smart contracts, transactions, and token standards. A multi-protocol dApp can operate across multiple blockchains, allowing users to interact with assets, tokens, and features from different chains within the platform, enhancing user flexibility and app functionality.\
      \\
3. Decentralized Identity Systems (DID):\
   Web3 focuses on decentralized identity systems that allow users to own and control their identities across platforms. Multi-protocol communication enables integrating different DID systems to provide a unified experience, ensuring users can manage and use their decentralized identities seamlessly across different platforms and blockchains.\
   \\
4. Oracles and Off-Chain Data:\
   Oracles connect blockchains with off-chain data, such as price feeds or real-world events, necessary for executing smart contracts. A multi-protocol communication framework allows oracles to gather data from various external sources using different protocols and deliver that information securely to different blockchains. This ensures that dApps can interact with the real world in a reliable, decentralized manner.\
   \\
5. Web3 Wallets and Cross-Platform Asset Management:\
   Web3 wallets that support multiple blockchain protocols allow users to manage and interact with digital assets, tokens, and applications across different blockchain networks in one interface.\
   \
   Importance of Multi-Protocol Communication in Web3\
   \
   Multi-protocol communication is vital for the interoperability and connectivity that Web3 seeks to achieve. Since the decentralized web comprises numerous blockchains and protocols, enabling these systems to communicate seamlessly is essential for creating a more cohesive, user-friendly, and interoperable decentralized ecosystem. This allows assets, data, and identity to move freely across different platforms and chains, maximizing the potential of Web3.\
   \
   Swall plans to integrate with multiple decentralized communication protocols, including Nostr, Farcaster, Ethereum, Nervos, and SUI. This will allow users to choose their preferred communication method, whether on-chain or off-chain, ensuring seamless platform connectivity. By supporting multiple protocols, Swall ensures that users can engage with Web3 applications flexibly and efficiently.\
    \
   **7. Is Swall available on mobile?** \
   Yes, Swall is available as a Progressive Web App (PWA). You can easily add the Swall icon to your home screen for quick and easy access.\
    \
   **8. How do I add Swall to my mobile home screen?** \
   For Android: Open Swall in your browser, tap the menu button (three dots), and select "Add to Home Screen." \
   For iOS: Open Swall in Safari, tap the share button, and select "Add to Home Screen."\
    \
   **9. How does the JoyID login work?** \
   JoyID allows you to log in to Swall using a passkey system, which eliminates the need for traditional passwords. This secure, user-friendly method ensures access to your account without relying on centralized password storage. With passkeys, your credentials are tied to your device, enhancing security and convenience. \

    \
   **10. What is a key pair, and why is the private key important?** \
   A key pair consists of a public key (used as your address on the blockchain) and a private key (which grants access to your wallet and assets). The private key is crucial for security—never share it. If lost or compromised, you could lose control of your digital assets.\
    \
   **11. What tokens will be supported in the future?**\
   Swall plans to support more UTXO-based tokens, expanding beyond CKB, Seal, and BTC. This will allow users to earn and manage a broader range of tokens.\
    \
   **12. How do I collaborate with other creators on Swall?** \
   You can collaborate by cross-promoting channels, participating in joint campaigns, or creating shared content. Collaboration can help you attract new audiences and grow your community.\
    \
   **13. What is the Swall marketplace?** \
   The Swall marketplace allows creators to sell exclusive memes, digital assets, and merchandise directly to their followers, giving creators additional ways to monetize their content.\
    \
   **14. What happens if I lose my private key?** \
   If you lose your private key, you risk losing access to your wallet and assets. Always store your private key securely, preferably in a hardware wallet or another secure backup method.\
    \
   **15. How does Swall protect my identity and assets?** \
   Swall operates on decentralized principles, meaning your identity and assets are fully under your control. Your data is not stored on centralized servers, and your private key ensures the security of your assets.\
