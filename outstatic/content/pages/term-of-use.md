Effective Date: 1st September 2024\
 \
Welcome to Swall! These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Swall platform, website, and any related applications or services (collectively, the “Services”). By accessing or using our Services, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use our Services.\
 \

By creating an account, accessing, or using the Services, you affirm that you are at least 18 years old (or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction) and capable of entering into a binding agreement.

2. Modifications to Terms\
 \
Swall reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated Terms on our website and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Services after any changes to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.\
 \
3. Account Registration and Security\
 \
Account Creation: To use certain service features, you must create an account by providing accurate and complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and all activities under your account.\
 \
Account Security: You agree to notify Swall immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other security breach. Swall will not be liable for any losses from unauthorized access to your account.\
 \
4. Use of Services\
 \
Permitted Use: You may use the Services only for lawful purposes and following these Terms. You agree not to use the Services in any way that violates any applicable laws or regulations.\
 \
Prohibited Conduct: You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities:\
Accessing or using the Services in any manner that could disable, overburden, or impair the Services or interfere with any other party’s use of the Services.\
Using any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means to access the Services without our express written permission.\
Attempting to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the Services, other accounts, computer systems, or networks connected to the Services.\
Engaging in any fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative activities.\
Uploading, posting, or transmitting any illegal, harmful, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable content.\
 \
5. Content and Intellectual Property\
 \
Your Content: You retain ownership of any content you create, upload, or otherwise make available on the Services (“Your Content”). By submitting Your Content, you grant Swall a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, distribute, modify, display, and perform Your Content in connection with the operation and promotion of the Services.\
 \
Copyright Protection and Liabilities: Swall respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users to do the same. You may not upload, post, or transmit any content that infringes upon any person or entity's copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights. If you believe your copyrighted work has been infringed upon, please notify us immediately using the contact information below. Swall reserves the right to block access to any content that allegedly infringes on another party's intellectual property rights and to block the accounts of repeat infringers.\
 \
Swall’s Content: All content and materials available on the Services, including text, graphics, logos, images, and software, are the property of Swall or its licensors and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from any content provided by Swall without our express written permission.\
 \
6. Transactions, Fees, and Wallets\
 \
Transactions: The Services may allow you to conduct transactions like purchasing licenses or tipping other users. All transactions conducted on the Services are final and non-refundable, except as required by law or as explicitly stated by Swall.\
 \
Fees: Swall may charge fees for certain transactions or services. Any applicable fees will be disclosed to you before you complete a transaction. You are responsible for paying all costs associated with using the Services.\
 \
Wallets: Swall enables users to connect and use wallets for transactions on the platform. By connecting a wallet, you agree to abide by the terms of service and privacy policies of the wallet provider. Swall is not responsible for any issues arising from third-party wallets, including but not limited to the loss of funds, unauthorized access, or transaction errors. You are responsible for ensuring the security of your wallet and any associated transactions.\
 \
7. Blockchain and Cryptocurrency\
 \
Blockchain Transactions: Swall interacts with public blockchain networks, which are decentralized and not controlled by Swall. By using the Services, you acknowledge that Swall has no control over blockchain transactions and cannot reverse or modify them once they are confirmed.\
 \
Cryptocurrency Risks: Transactions involving cryptocurrencies are inherently risky and volatile. You acknowledge and accept the risks associated with using cryptocurrencies, including the potential for loss of funds. Swall is not responsible for any losses you may incur from using cryptocurrencies on the platform.\
 \
8. Community-Driven Content Blocking and Account Suspension\
 \
User and Community Moderation: Swall operates on a decentralized platform where the community manages content blocking and account suspension, not Swall. Users and the community can flag content or accounts they believe violate these Terms or are otherwise objectionable.\
 \
Content Blocking: If a sufficient number of users or community members flag certain content, it may be blocked, making it inaccessible on the platform. However, Swall cannot delete content that exists on a decentralized blockchain.\
 \
Account Suspension: Similarly, if the community flags an account for violating these Terms, it may be suspended, limiting the user's ability to access or interact with the Services. Swall cannot delete accounts but can enforce suspension based on community moderation.\
 \
9. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability\
 \
Disclaimer of Warranties: The Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without express or implied warranties. Swall disclaims all warranties, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\
 \
Limitation of Liability: To the fullest extent permitted by law, Swall will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your use or inability to use the Services; (b) any unauthorized access to or use of our servers or any personal information; (c) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Services; or (d) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through our Services by any third party.\
 \
10. Indemnification\
 \
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Swall, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms or your use of the Services, including any infringement of intellectual property rights or any other rights of any third party.\
 \
11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution\
 \
Governing Law: These Terms are governed by and construed by the laws of the jurisdiction deemed appropriate by the company when a dispute arises, without regard to any conflict of law principles. The company reserves the right to select the governing jurisdiction at its sole discretion should a legal matter arise, ensuring that any conflict of law rules requiring the application of the law of another jurisdiction are excluded.\
 \
Dispute Resolution: Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services shall be resolved through binding arbitration under the rules of a recognized arbitration body, as selected by the company at the time of the dispute. The arbitration process and any related legal proceedings will follow the laws of the jurisdiction chosen by the company. The company also reserves the right to seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, which shall be determined at the company’s discretion, to prevent any actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of intellectual property rights.\
\
12. Miscellaneous\
 \
Entire Agreement: These Terms, along with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Swall concerning the Services and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, or representations, whether written or oral.\
 \
Severability: If any provision of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\
 \
Waiver: No term or condition in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition.\
